# Short-Term Atrial Fibrillation Detection Using Electrocardiograms: A Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches

This repository contains the implementation for the above-mentioned manuscript submitted to the International Journal of Medical Informatics (IJMEDI).

In order to use run the Jyputer notebooks, you should first download the below four databases from PhysioNet website (https://physionet.org/). Then, put them a folder named "data" in the same path of the notebooks files.

* MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/) 
* MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
* Long Term AF Database (https://physionet.org/content/ltafdb/1.0.0/)
* MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/)
