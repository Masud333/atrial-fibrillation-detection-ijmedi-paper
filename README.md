In order to use run the Jyputer notebooks, you should first download the below four databases from PhysioNet website (https://physionet.org/). Then, put them a folder named "data" in the same path of the notebooks files.

* MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/) 
* MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
* Long Term AF Database (https://physionet.org/content/ltafdb/1.0.0/)
* MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/)

By executing the "main.ipynb" file, you can reproduce the results presented in the manuscript.

:point_right: The first version of this repository has been developed by Masud Shah Jahan during the course of his Bachelor thesis at the University of Southern Denmark and it has been modified afterwards to the current version by Abdolrahman Peimankar.
